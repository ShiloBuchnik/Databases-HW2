# Databases-HW2
### In this assignment we've emulated an "airbnb" database, using PostgreSQL
The database stores details about:
Apartments, apartment owners, reservations, customers and reviews.  

We've also implemented (in `solution.py`) an API for the database, divided to "CRUD", "basic" and "advanced".  
The documentation for each function is in `Dry.pdf`.
